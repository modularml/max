# Basic example for MAX Graph API ðŸ”¥

This is a very simple example of how to build a model with the MAX Graph API
and execute it with MAX Engine.

For a walkthrough of this code, see the quickstart guide to [build a graph with
MAX Graph](https://docs.modular.com/engine/graph/get-started).

## Usage

First, install MAX as per the [MAX get started
guide](https://docs.modular.com/engine/get-started/).

Then run `basic.ðŸ”¥` from a command line:

```shell
mojo basic.ðŸ”¥
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
Input: input0
Output: output0
Tensor([[1.0],
[1.0]], dtype=float32, shape=2x1)
```
