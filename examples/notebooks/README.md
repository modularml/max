# MAX Jupyter notebooks

MAX and Mojo supports programming in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/),
just like Python.

This page explains how to get started with MAX example notebooks, and this
repo directory contains notebooks that demonstrate some of MAX features.

If you're not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, they're files that allow you to create
documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text.
They're basically documents with executable code blocks, making them great for
sharing code experiments and programming tutorials.

## Get started in VS Code

Visual Studio Code is a great environment for programming with Jupyter notebooks.
Especially if you're developing with MAX and Mojo on a remote system, using VS
Code is ideal because it allows you to edit and interact with notebooks on the
remote machine where you've installed MAX.

All you need is MAX and the Jupyter VS Code extension:

1. Install the [MAX SDK](https://developer.modular.com/download).

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the
   [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).

3. Then open any `.ipynb` file with MAX code, click **Select Kernel** in the top-right
corner of the document, and then select **Jupyter Kernel > Python** or
**Jupyter Kernel > Mojo**.

   The Mojo kernel should have been installed automatically when you installed
the Mojo SDK. If the Mojo kernel is not listed, make sure that your
`$MODULAR_HOME` environment variable is set on the system where you installed
MAX (specified in the `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` file).

   Now run some MAX code!

## Get started with JupyterLab

You can also run MAX notebooks in a local instance of JupyterLab. The following
is just a quick setup guide for Linux users with the Mojo SDK installed locally
, and it might not work with your system (these instructions don't support
remote access to the JupyterLab). For more details about using JupyterLab,
see the complete [JupyterLab installation guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html).

**Note:** You must run this setup on the same machine where you've installed
the [Mojo SDK](https://developer.modular.com/download). However, syntax
highlighting for Mojo code is not currently enabled in JupyterLab (coming soon).

1. Install JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
    ```

2. Make sure the user-level `bin` is in your `$PATH`:

    ```sh
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```

3. Launch JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

4. When you open any of the `.ipynb` notebooks from this repository, JupyterLab
should automatically select the Mojo kernel (which was installed with the Mojo SDK).

   Now run some MAX code!

## Notes and tips

- Code in a Jupyter notebook cell behaves like code in a Mojo REPL environment:
The `main()` function is not required, but there are some caveats:

  - Top-level variables (variables declared outside a function) are not visible
inside functions.

  - Redefining undeclared variables is not supported (variables without a
`let` or `var` in front). If youâ€™d like to redefine a variable across notebook
cells, you must declare the variable with either `let` or `var`.

- If you are using the Mojo kernel, you can use `%%python` at the top of a
code cell and write normal Python code. Variables, functions, and imports
defined in a Python cell are available from subsequent Mojo code cells.
