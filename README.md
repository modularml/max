# MAX code examples

This is a collection of sample programs, notebooks, and tools which highlight the power of the [MAX platform](https://www.modular.com/max).  This includes:

1. **inference:** 
    These examples download a pre-trained model and showcase how to run it with the MAX inference engine. For certain models, deploying to Triton is also available.
   
2. **notebooks:** 
    Includes Jupyter notebooks for an interactive learning experience.
   
3. **tools:** 
    This demonstrates benchmarking and visualization tooling that's available to use with MAX.
