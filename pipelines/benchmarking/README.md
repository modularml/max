# Benchmark MAX Serve

This repository contains tools to benchmark
[MAX Serve](https://docs.modular.com/max/serve/) performance. You can also use
these scripts to compare different LLM serving backends such as
[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and
[TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) against MAX. The
benchmarking tools measure throughput, latency, and resource utilization
metrics.

> The `benchmark_serving.py` script is adapted from
> [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/benchmarks),
> licensed under Apache 2.0. We forked this script to ensure consistency with
> vLLM's measurement methodology and extended it with features we found helpful,
> such as client-side GPU metric collection via `nvitop`.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To benchmark model performance with the provided scripts, be sure to have the
following:

- [Install Magic](https://docs.modular.com/magic/#install-magic)
- Python 3.9.0 - 3.12.0
- A local or cloud environment with access to NVIDIA A100 GPUs (the benchmarking
 scripts are also compatible with A10, L4, and L40 GPUs)
- A Hugging Face account

### Install requirements

Clone the repository and navigate to the `benchmarks` directory.

```bash
git clone -b nightly https://github.com/modularml/max.git
cd pipelines/benchmarking
```

install the dependencies via

```bash
magic install
```

### Prepare benchmarking dataset

We recommend using the
[ShareGPT](
  https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered)
dataset for benchmarking model performance. You can download the dataset with
the following command:

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered\
/resolve/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json
```

You can optionally use your own datasets for custom evaluations.

### Verify model access through Hugging Face

To download and use
[Llama 3.1 8B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
from Hugging Face, you must have a Hugging Face account, a Hugging Face user
access token, and access to Meta's Llama 3.1 Hugging Face gated repository.

To create a Hugging Face user access token, see
[Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Within your local
environment, save your access token as an environment variable.

```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"
```

Use your user access token to log into Hugging Face.

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

Verify that you have access to the
[Llama 3.1 8B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
model. For more information, see
[Access gated models as a user](
  https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated).

## Benchmarking scripts

This repository provides the following script to benchmark MAX Serve:

### HTTP endpoint benchmarking with `benchmark_serving.py`

First enter the dedicate shell for the project via:

```bash
magic shell
```

Then we can benchmark any HTTP endpoint that implements
OpenAI-compatible APIs as follows:

```bash
python benchmark_serving.py \
    --base-url https://company_url.xyz \
    --endpoint /v1/completions \
    --backend modular \
    --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
    --dataset-path ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json \
    --num-prompts 500
```

Notes:

 1. To exit the Magic shell simply run `exit`.

 2. For more details about Magic, please see this [step-by-step guide to Magic](https://docs.modular.com/max/tutorials/magic/).

Key features:

- Tests any OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint
- Supports both chat and completion APIs
- Measures detailed latency metrics
- Works with hosted services

## Output

Results are saved in JSON format under the `results/` directory with the
following naming convention:

```bash
{backend}-{request_rate}qps-{model_name}-{timestamp}.json
```

The output should look similar to the following:

```bash

- Check GPU memory availability: `nvidia-smi`

### Permission issues

- Verify `HF_TOKEN` is set correctly
